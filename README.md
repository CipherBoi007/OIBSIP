# 🌸 Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

This project focuses on building a classification model using the classic Iris dataset to predict the species of iris flowers.

## 📂 Files
- `iris.csv` – Dataset
- `iris.ipynb` – Data analysis, visualization, and classification model
- `README.md` – Task details

## 🔍 Objective
To classify iris flowers among three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using petal and sepal dimensions.

## 📊 Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## ✅ Result
Achieved over 95% accuracy using supervised classification models.
