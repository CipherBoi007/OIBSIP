📊 Unemployment Rate Analysis During COVID-19

🔍 Project Overview
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate, which represents the number of unemployed individuals as a percentage of the total labor force. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the world saw a sharp increase in unemployment rates, disrupting economies globally.

This project aims to analyze the patterns, causes, and impacts of rising unemployment rates during the COVID-19 era using data science tools and techniques. Through data visualization, statistical insights, and trend analysis, this project provides a clear understanding of how the pandemic affected employment.

📌 Objectives
Analyze unemployment data across different regions and timeframes.

Visualize trends before, during, and after COVID-19.

Identify the sectors most affected.

Explore correlations between lockdown measures and unemployment rates.
